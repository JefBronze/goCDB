# goCDB Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
goCDB is a comprehensive Group Travel Management Platform featuring a mobile app (React Native), admin panel (Next.js), and backend API (Node.js). This roadmap follows an **admin-panel-first approach** to provide visual control and validation throughout development.

## Development Philosophy
- **Visual-First Development**: Every backend feature has immediate admin UI
- **Incremental Validation**: Test each feature through visual interfaces as built
- **Full Control**: Complete visibility into all system operations
- **Real-time Feedback**: Hot reload and instant visual updates

## Timeline Overview
- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundation & User Management
- **Weeks 3-5**: Core Features (Groups, Trips, Finances)
- **Weeks 6-8**: Mobile App Development
- **Weeks 9-11**: Advanced Features & Integrations
- **Weeks 12-14**: Production Preparation
- **Weeks 15-16**: Deployment & Launch
